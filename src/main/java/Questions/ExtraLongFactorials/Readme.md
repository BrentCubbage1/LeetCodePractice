The factorial of the integer , written , is defined as:

n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) *...*3 * 2 * 1

Calculate and print the factorial of a given integer.

For example, if , we calculate n = 30. we calculate 30 * 29 * 28 *... * 2 * 1 and get 265252859812910586363084800000000.

Function Description

Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.


Note: Factorials of  can't be stored even in a  long long variable. Big integers must be used for such calculations. 
Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.

We recommend solving this challenge using BigIntegers.
